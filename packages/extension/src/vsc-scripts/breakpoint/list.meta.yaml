    when_to_use: |
      USE FOR:
      - Inspecting current breakpoint configuration before debugging
      - Finding breakpoint locations to remove or modify
      - Verifying breakpoints were set correctly

      DON'T USE FOR:
      - Setting breakpoints (use breakpoint.set instead)
      - Removing breakpoints (use breakpoint.remove/clear-file/clear-project)

      PREREQUISITES:
      - None (always safe to query)

      SAFETY:
      - Read-only operation (no state changes)
      - Idempotent (querying multiple times returns same results)
