    when_to_use: |
      USE FOR:
      - Complete reset of debugging state across workspace
      - Starting fresh debugging session without old breakpoints
      - Cleanup before setting new systematic breakpoints

      DON'T USE FOR:
      - Clearing breakpoints in a single file (use breakpoint.clear-file instead)
      - Removing a specific breakpoint (use breakpoint.remove instead)

      PREREQUISITES:
      - None (always safe to execute)

      SAFETY:
      - Idempotent (clearing twice achieves same result)
      - Not destructive (breakpoints can be re-added easily)
