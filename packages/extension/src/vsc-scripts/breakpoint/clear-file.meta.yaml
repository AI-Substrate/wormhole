    when_to_use: |
      USE FOR:
      - Removing all breakpoints from a single file when refactoring or debugging
      - Cleaning up file-specific breakpoints before setting new ones
      - Quick reset of debugging state for one file

      DON'T USE FOR:
      - Clearing all workspace breakpoints (use breakpoint.clear-project instead)
      - Removing a single specific breakpoint (use breakpoint.remove instead)

      PREREQUISITES:
      - File must exist in workspace (path must be valid)
      - No active debug session required (can clear at any time)

      SAFETY:
      - Idempotent (clearing twice achieves same result)
      - Not destructive (breakpoints can be re-added easily)

        examples:

          - "lib/utils/helper.ts"
        note: "Prefer workspace-relative paths for portability"
