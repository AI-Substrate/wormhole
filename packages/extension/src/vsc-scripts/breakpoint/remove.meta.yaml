    when_to_use: |
      USE FOR:
      - Removing a single specific breakpoint by location
      - Selective cleanup of breakpoints during debugging
      - Disabling one breakpoint while keeping others

      DON'T USE FOR:
      - Clearing all breakpoints in a file (use breakpoint.clear-file instead)
      - Clearing all workspace breakpoints (use breakpoint.clear-project instead)

      PREREQUISITES:
      - Breakpoint must exist at specified file and line
      - File must exist in workspace

      SAFETY:
      - Idempotent (removing same breakpoint twice is safe)
      - Not destructive (breakpoint can be re-added easily)

        examples:

          - "/absolute/path/to/file.py"
          - "test/integration/api.test.ts"
        note: "Must match path used when breakpoint was created"

        examples: ["10", "42", "150"]
        note: "Must match exact line where breakpoint was set"
