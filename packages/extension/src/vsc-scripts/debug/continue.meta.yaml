    when_to_use: |
      USE FOR:
      - Resuming execution after hitting breakpoint
      - Running program until next breakpoint
      - Continuing after step operation

      DON'T USE FOR:
      - Starting new session (use debug.start instead)
      - Stepping through code line-by-line (use debug.step-over instead)
      - Stopping execution (use debug.stop instead)

      PREREQUISITES:
      - Active debug session from debug.start
      - Session must be paused at breakpoint

      SAFETY:
      - Not idempotent (continuing twice advances execution twice)
      - Modifies execution state (resumes program)
      - Medium timeout (10s default)
