    when_to_use: |
      USE FOR:
      - Triggering test discovery by opening the Testing UI
      - Forcing VS Code to scan workspace for tests
      - Enabling test functionality that requires the Testing view to be visible

      DON'T USE FOR:
      - Running or debugging tests (use tests.debug-single or debug.start)
      - Listing tests via API (this is a UI trigger, not a query)
      - Continuous test watching (this is a one-time UI open)

      PREREQUISITES:
      - Test framework configured in workspace (pytest, Jest, etc.)
      - Test extensions installed and enabled

      SAFETY:
      - Non-idempotent (opening UI multiple times may have side effects)
      - Triggers test discovery which scans filesystem
