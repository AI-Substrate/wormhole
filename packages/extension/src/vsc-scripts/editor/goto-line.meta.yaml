    Opens a file in the VS Code editor and navigates to a specific line and column position.
    The target line is automatically centered in the viewport for optimal visibility.
    Opens files as permanent tabs (not preview tabs).

    when_to_use: |
      USE FOR:
      - Navigating to a specific location in a file (e.g., error location, reference location)
      - Opening files at specific lines from code analysis or search results
      - Jumping to code locations mentioned in logs or test output
      - Programmatically opening files with cursor positioning

      DON'T USE FOR:
      - Just opening a file without specific line navigation (use VS Code open command)
      - Setting breakpoints (use breakpoint.set instead)
      - Selecting ranges of text (this sets cursor position only)
      - Opening files that don't exist (will fail with FILE_NOT_FOUND)

      PREREQUISITES:
      - File must exist and be readable
      - Path must be absolute (not relative)
      - Line/column numbers must be within valid range for the file

      SAFETY:
      - Read-only operation (doesn't modify files)
      - Idempotent (can be called multiple times safely)
      - Opens permanent tabs (not preview tabs)

    parameter_hints:
      path: Must be an absolute path (e.g., /workspaces/project/src/file.js, not src/file.js)
      line: Line numbers are 1-indexed (first line is 1, not 0)
      column: Column numbers are 1-indexed (first column is 1, not 0). Defaults to 1 if not specified.
