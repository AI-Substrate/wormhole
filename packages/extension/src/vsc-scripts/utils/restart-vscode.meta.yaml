    when_to_use: |
      USE FOR:
      - Applying extension updates that require window reload
      - Resetting VS Code state after configuration changes
      - Recovering from extension conflicts or errors
      - Completing workflows that modify extensions (after install/uninstall)

      DON'T USE FOR:
      - Normal debugging workflows (not required for debug sessions)
      - Applying settings changes (most apply without reload)
      - Routine operations (this is disruptive)

      PREREQUISITES:
      - User has saved all important work (unsaved changes will be lost!)
      - No critical debug session in progress

      SAFETY:
      - ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE: Kills editor process, loses unsaved work
      - Non-idempotent (each reload restarts entire window)
      - This is the ONLY tool with destructive=true
